This repository contains my solutions for Project 1 of the Artificial Intelligence course at Harokopio University.

The project involves implementing classic search algorithms (DFS, BFS, UCS, A*) and adversarial agents (Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, Expectimax) for the Pacman environment. Additionally, custom evaluation functions and heuristics were designed to optimize agent decision-making and performance.

🏁 Key Features:
- Depth-First, Breadth-First, Uniform Cost, and A* Search
- Minimax and Expectimax agents with Alpha-Beta pruning
- Custom heuristics and evaluation functions
- Strategy analysis and agent behavior discussion
- Performance evaluation using the Autograder tool
